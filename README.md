## Probability

[Probs.ipynb](src/the_mountain/probs.ipynb)

This notebook explores the probability of rolling two dice, adding the numbers together then plotting the results. 

First though - start with paper! All you need is a pen and paper and 2 dice. Draw something up that looks like this:

![Dice](resources/img/how-to-start.png)

Now gets to rolling! 

We had a fun conversation about why certaing numbers kept coming up so we wrote the combinations down. Some numbers have more combinations than others! :)

Then you can run the notebook to simulate rolling the dice 100,000 times. 

### Extensions

A fun exercise is to see what happens if you use 3 dice (or more).
